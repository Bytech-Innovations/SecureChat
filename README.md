# The SecureChat Manifesto

---

**We believe that the right to privacy is not just a luxury but an innate, universal, inalienable, and sacred right, inherent to all individuals, regardless of race, nationality, creed, or circumstance. It is the bedrock of freedom, the cornerstone of individuality, and the shield against tyranny. Our mission is to protect this right with unyielding resolve through the development of the most secure chat system the world - SecureChat.**

**Anonymity:** Registration shall never require Personal Identifiable Information (PII) such as ID, Email, or Phone.

**Security:** Every message sent through SecureChat shall be encrypted end-to-end. Only the sender and the intended recipient shall read it.

**Zero Data Storage:** Even the encrypted messages shall not be stored on the server. Only offline messages shall be saved temporarily until they are delivered.

**Record-less Client:** All chat history shall be deleted automatically when the client application is terminated.
